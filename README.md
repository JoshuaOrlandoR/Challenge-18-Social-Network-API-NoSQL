  ## Description
  This application is the backend API for a Social Media app. This backend is supported and powered by NoSQL and MongoDB databases, and is tested through insomnia and MongoDB compass! 

  ## Requirements
  In order to use this API backend, users must utilize a programming enviornment like VS Code. They must also ensure they have mongoDB installed on their machine, and is set up correctly. 

  ## Installation
  To install the application, users must download or clone this repository, and open it in VS code (or any other programming enviornment). Once this is done, users must open this repo with their programming enviornment, and open an integrated terminal. Next, install dependencies with npm i. To start the program (which is locally hosted), type npm start. To look at the databases, utilize mongodb compass. To test the routes, utilize any POST tool, like insomnia. Refer to the walkthrough video for more information on testing these routes. 

  ## Useage
  This program, itself, does not do anything. There is no front-end for users to interact with. However, there are many routes users can test, as previously mentioned. These tests, and a showcase of what users can accomplish with this social media backend, can be seen in the walkthrough video, below!
